## Upgrading React

First, see the create-react-app [ChangeLog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
and follow any instructions in the *Migrating from* sections before performing the upgrade.

Then:

```
npm install --save --save-exact react-scripts@3.0.1
```

(Replace 3.0.1 with the latest version of course!)

## Upgrading all the other npm modules including Material-UI

```
npm install
```

## NOTE: package.json will be updated and should be committed to the repo
